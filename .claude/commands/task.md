description: Get next task and start working on it

# Task Workflow

1. **Get next task**: Run `task next` to see the highest priority pending task
2. **Understand context**: Read related PRDs in `.taskmaster/docs/`
3. **Implement**: Write the code following CLAUDE.md patterns
4. **Complete**: Mark task done with `task set-status <id> done`

Focus on shipping - don't over-engineer. Each task should result in a working increment.
