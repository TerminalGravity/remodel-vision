## Persona Overview

### Meet Sarah Chen

**Age:** 34
**Occupation:** Marketing Manager at a tech startup
**Location:** Denver, Colorado
**Household:** Married, 2 kids (ages 4 and 7)
**Property:** 1960s ranch-style home, 1,800 sqft, purchased 3 years ago

---

## Profile Summary

Sarah is a first-time homeowner tackling her first major renovation—a full kitchen remodel. She's handy enough to paint and do basic repairs, but this is her biggest project yet. She's been saving for 2 years and wants to get it right the first time without hiring an interior designer (too expensive) or making costly mistakes.

### The Quote

> "I have a Pinterest board with 200 pins, YouTube videos for everything, and no idea how to actually make decisions. I just want to SEE what my kitchen would look like before I spend $40,000."

## Goals & Motivations

### Primary Goals

2. **Stay Within Budget**
   - Track costs as design evolves
   - Get alerts when choices exceed budget
   - Find alternatives that achieve similar looks for less

3. **Make Confident Decisions**
   - Understand what will work in their specific space
   - Validate that color/material combinations look good together
   - Confirm measurements before ordering

4. **Plan the Project Realistically**
   - Understand the sequence of work
   - Know what can be DIY vs. needs a pro
   - Create a timeline that fits their life

### Secondary Goals

- Impress spouse/partner with professional-looking designs
- Learn about materials and trends
- Avoid the stress of dealing with contractors for small decisions
- Have a clear plan to show contractors for quotes

| **Measurement confusion** | Hand-drawn sketches, measuring tape | Ordering wrong sizes |
| **No single source of truth** | Notes app, spreadsheets, folders | Losing track of decisions |
| **Overwhelming options** | Hours of browsing | Decision fatigue |
| **Budget creep** | Mental math | Surprise overruns |
| **Contractor communication** | Verbal descriptions, photo collages | Misunderstandings, rework |

"This will be   "There are    "I can't      "Why is this   "Just pick   "I wish I
 amazing!"      so many       decide"       so hard?"       something"   had..."
                options"
```

### Specific Frustrations

1. **"I found the perfect cabinet on Instagram but I don't know if it fits my space"**
   - Inspiration disconnected from their actual room dimensions

2. **"Every design app wants me to start from scratch"**
   - Doesn't want to draw floor plans manually
   - Wants to upload their home and start designing

3. **"I spent 3 hours choosing a backsplash and still don't know if it'll look good"**
   - Can't see materials in context of their actual kitchen

4. **"My contractor asked what I want and I couldn't explain it"**
   - No professional renderings to share
   - Ends up showing random Pinterest photos

5. **"I ordered the wrong size island"**
   - Measurements were off
   - Didn't account for door swings, walkways
